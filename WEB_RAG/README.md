# **WEB RAG – Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Web-Based Knowledge Retrieval**  
   **Enhancing knowledge retrieval with search-based retrieval and generative AI models**
## Overview  
WEB RAG is a **web-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that efficiently retrieves and generates context-aware information from large-scale text data. It is designed to enhance applications in **medical research, legal document analysis, and enterprise knowledge management**.  

## Key Features  
- **Efficient Document Retrieval** – Utilizes vector databases and embeddings for precise search.  
- **Context-Aware Generation** – Augments retrieved knowledge with AI-driven text generation.  
- **Multi-Source Data Integration** – Supports structured and unstructured data from multiple sources.  
- **Scalable Web-Based Interface** – Enables seamless access and interaction with the RAG model.  

## Impact  
- **Enables efficient information retrieval** for research-intensive domains.  
- **Reduces manual document analysis time**, streamlining workflows.  
- **Enhances response accuracy** by grounding AI-generated content in real-world data.  

## Installation & Setup  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saipraneeth314/Generative-AI-Applications.git
   cd Generative-AI-Applications/WEB_RAG
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Future Enhancements  
- Improve multi-document retrieval performance.  
- Integrate advanced ranking mechanisms for better results.  
- Expand support for more file formats (PDFs, HTML, etc.).
