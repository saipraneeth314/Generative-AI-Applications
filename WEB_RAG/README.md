# **WEB RAG – Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Web-Based Knowledge Retrieval**  

## Overview  
WEB RAG is a **web-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that efficiently retrieves and generates context-aware information from large-scale text data. It is designed to enhance applications in **medical research, legal document analysis, and enterprise knowledge management**.  

## Key Features  
- **Efficient Document Retrieval** – Utilizes vector databases and embeddings for precise search.  
- **Context-Aware Generation** – Augments retrieved knowledge with AI-driven text generation.  
- **Multi-Source Data Integration** – Supports structured and unstructured data from multiple sources.  
- **Scalable Web-Based Interface** – Enables seamless access and interaction with the RAG model.  

## Tech Stack  
- **LLMs:** Groq AI, OpenAI GPT  
- **Framework:** LangSmith, LangChain, Haugging Face.  
- **Programming Language:** Python. 

## Impact  
- **Enables efficient information retrieval** for research-intensive domains.  
- **Reduces manual document analysis time**, streamlining workflows.  
- **Enhances response accuracy** by grounding AI-generated content in real-world data.
